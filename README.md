we have setup a discord for all our members to discuss and plan the Assignment. We have all started on seperating the Assignment into differant sections for us to complete. We are in the proccess of coming up with an group idea. Me personally have been struggling to come up with an idea for a Group Project. Website is coming along nice. I am trying to make it as user friendly as possible.

Advised everyone to get onto the discord server set up by Jamie and organized a time with the group members to have a meeting to discuss the allocations for the assignment.

Jock: 08 of April
Broke the assignment up into portions and reccomended how we should allocate the tasks based on the amount of people we had in our group being Five. Had good feedback from the group and we all took up our allocated portions. 

Jock: 12th of April
Finalized my allocated portion of the assignment and made it public to our group chat on discord for review by our team members.
