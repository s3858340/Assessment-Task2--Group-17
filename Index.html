<p style="text-align:left;">My name is Kira Devine, my student number is s3730230. I have been living in Perth since my family moved from Tom Price in approx. 1996. I started working
	during high school at around 15 years old in food service, moved onto retail and then the oil & oas industry beginning as an Admin in 2015 and now work as a Logistics Coordinator.
	As well as working full-time, I am in my final year of a Bachelor of Business majoring in Logistics & SCM. Unfortunately, between work and studies I have limited time to focus on my
	hobbies but I enjoy baking, exercising with friends i.e. hikes, squash games, I also spend quite a bit of time walking and training my two dogs who are both Australian Kelpies. I have
	very little experience in IT but am interested in finding innovative ways to use IT at work to create some automation in my tasks. </p>

					 during the crisis. I have relatively no IT experience but have been fascinated by the subject. Looking for a career change, IT has felt like the way to go and so far I am enjoying
					 the challenge.
